#  GPT-2 Minimal Implementation in PyTorch

This repository provides a modular and educational implementation of a GPT-2-like Transformer language model using **PyTorch**, built from scratch. It includes tools for training, inference, evaluation, and tokenization.


---

##  Features

-  GPT-2 Transformer architecture (decoder-only)
-  Attention, Feedforward, GELU, and LayerNorm from scratch
-  Tokenization using [`tiktoken`](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken)
-  Training and validation with loss & perplexity evaluation
-  Inference with configurable sampling (`temperature`, `top_k`)
-  Fully modular and extendable

---

##  Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpt2-pytorch.git
cd gpt2-pytorch
````

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

##  Training

To train the GPT model:

```bash
python TrainAndSaveGptWeights.py
```

You will be prompted to enter:

* Model configuration (context length, embedding dimension, heads, layers)
* Path to training data
* Epochs, starting context, and save path for weights

###  Data format

A plain `.txt` file with training text is required. The model uses a tokenizer to convert text into tokens.

---

##  Inference

Once trained, run the inference:

```bash
python inference_model.py
```

You will be prompted to:

* Enter model config again (same as training)
* Load the saved model weights
* Enter a prompt to generate text

---

##  Evaluation Metrics

* Cross Entropy Loss
* Perplexity (automatically calculated)

---

##  Dependencies

Installable via `requirements.txt`:

* `torch`
* `tiktoken`

---

##  Model Architecture

The Transformer model is implemented from scratch with components:

* Multi-head Self-Attention
* GELU Activation
* Layer Normalization
* Residual Connections
* Position Embeddings
